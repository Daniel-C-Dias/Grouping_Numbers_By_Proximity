# Grouping_Numbers_By_Proximity
An algorithm that can take as an input an array of Integers and can group them into N groups depending on how close they are to each other.

The solution should solve the problem for any list of Integers and groups (provided the groups are less or equal to the total number of Integers). 
Furthermore, the solution needs to have the right level of automated testing to validate that it works, and that the code is resilient to modifications.

// Example 1:

group([16, 15, 14, 13, 34, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 45, 34, 23, 29, 12, 23, 45, 67, 23, 12, 34, 45, 23, 67, 23, 67], 3);


// generates 3 groups

[ [ 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 12 ],

[ 34, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 34, 23, 29, 23, 23, 34, 23, 23 ],

[ 45, 45, 67, 45, 67, 67 ] ]



// Example 2:

group([16, 15, 14, 13, 34, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 45, 34, 23, 29, 12, 23, 45, 67, 23, 12, 34, 45, 23, 67, 23, 670], 3);


// generates 3 groups

[ [ 16, 15, 14, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 23, 29, 12, 23, 23, 12, 23, 23 ],

[ 34, 45, 34, 45, 67, 34, 45, 67 ],

[ 670 ] ]



// Example 3:

group([160, 15, 14, 13, 34, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 45, 34, 23, 29, 12, 23, 45, 67, 23, 12, 34, 45, 23, 67, 23, 670], 4);


// generates 4 groups

[ [ 160 ],

[ 15, 14, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 23, 29, 12, 23, 23, 12, 23, 23 ],

[ 34, 45, 34, 45, 67, 34, 45, 67 ],

[ 670 ] ]



// Example 4:

group([16, 15, 14, 13, 34, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 45, 34, 23, 29, 12, 23, 45, 67, 23, 12, 34, 45, 23, 67, 23, 67], 5);


// generates 5 groups

[ [ 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 12 ],

[ 34, 34, 29, 34 ],

[ 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23 ],

[ 45, 45, 45 ],

[ 67, 67, 67 ] ]
